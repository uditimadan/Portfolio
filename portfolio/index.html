    <section id="about" class="section"> <h2>About Me</h2> <h4>Uditi Madan</h4>
        <p> Hi! I’m a Computer Science undergraduate with a minor in Business at the University of San Francisco, graduating in May 2026. I recently interned as an AI Intern at Oodles Technologies, where I integrated LLM APIs into existing software using Python, enhancing both functionality and user experience. This role deepened my technical expertise and strengthened my ability to apply AI in real-world web applications. I also have a strong passion for digital marketing. As part of Women in Technology, I created and promoted content across social media platforms to grow engagement and visibility for the club.</p>

        <p> <strong>I’m excited to pursue opportunities which blends my passion in both marketing and web development using genai tools, allowing me to bridge creative strategy with a technical execution :) </strong></p>
